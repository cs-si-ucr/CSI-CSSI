Serial Killing
------------------------
Chief: Jesus. Looks like we got another victim to investigate. I'll send for backup to clean this place up. Right now, try to investigate 
the place while we still have the opportunity.

To think that our investigation suspect would turn out as another victim. From looking at his records, he used to be an SI leader until
he left to go to Graduate school last quarter. That explains why he wasn't caught in the immediate net the day after the killings
when we went to get the alibis from the other SI leaders at the time. Before we came here, I also found out he used to work at Amazon as
an intern. He ended up ditching Amazon and wound up in Microsoft of all places. Probably a lot of hurt feelings over @ Amazon there.
