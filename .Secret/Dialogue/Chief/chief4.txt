A Hunch

Chief: When I used to work at Amazon, I knew the password to the Cult then, but not anymore. I left the company because of all the fanatics.

Something tells me we can get the password back at Andre's place. Cultist always like to leave a few links back to the base. It would surprise me
more if Andre's computer WASN'T tampered with knowing a certain someone still in the Cult. Remember the golden rule: passwords in terminal city
always 5 characters long, and have only lowercase letters.
