Welcome to the SIPD
------------------------
Chief: Hi detective, welcome to the SIPD (Supplemental Instruction Police Department). We hired you here to investigate a recent murder that has
taken place at the ARC here at UCR. A SI Leader, Omar Pereza, was murdered in the SI workroom @ 19:30 on February 4th of 2019. We've collected alibis
from each of the witnesses as well as the rest of the CS SI leaders. I know you're new to this town, so here's some basic commands to get you started:

ls | where you are
ls -a | searches a scene for any hidden clues
cd <dir> | go to that location
vim <file> | opens up a file
chmod +r <file> | adds read permissions to a file, you can use this to view confidential info
g++ <srcFile> -o <outputFile> | you should know what this does

You also have 'commands' that you alone can perform. To see your commands, type in 'commands'. The alibis and police report are
at the computer, so be sure to take a look.
