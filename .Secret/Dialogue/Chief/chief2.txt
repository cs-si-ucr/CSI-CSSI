------------------------
Chief: Now that you've taken a look at the documents (or not), let's get down to the real details of the case. We're thinking that Mr. Pereza's murder was
a random pokestop thugging gone wrong when he was off trying to catch a shiny Mewtwo on Pokemon Go at the park. The problem is we don't have a suspect or any
leads. The only thing we collected at the crime scene is his phone, which holds the last voice data message a few minutes before his death. An intern 
named Will who worked here before created a machine learning algorithm to match up any speech patterns to the voice database. However, he left before the 
project finished completion. Could you finish the project off? I've added the source code to Your_PC under Code, and also added Omar's phone to your Notes.

I have also provided you with the data on the location of each citizen in the city. Once you've fixed up the project, run the code to find a name. 
Find out where this person lives and investigate their address by heading to the Street. If you're stuck, use 'investigate --help' for guidance.
Rest assured, I'll be tagging along with you when you go investigate the house.
