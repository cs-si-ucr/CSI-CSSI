Chief: WAIT!! I'VE SEEN THIS ENCODING BEFORE!!...When I used to work as a nuclear physicist for Amazon,
Jeff Bezos himself used to tout this encoding propaganda. If you take 'AWS', copy-paste it 26 times,
one for each letter of the alphabet, A-Z, and put that through a base-64 encoding - then, take that
encoding, copy-paste that 26 MORE times and put that through another base-64 encoding, you end up with
that message. After carefully adding a newline character every 67 characters exactly, you wind up with
exactly 10 characters before the next line break. Back in the 2000s, Bezos realized how incredible
this was as these 10 blank characters could be substituted for 'MONEYMONEY', creating a perfect symbolic
center piece of what Amazon is focused on - $ and AWS, while simultaneously representing that Amazon
represents everything from A-Z not just once, but twice. This isn't just some simple Amazon fanboy at work here.
This must be the work of the Cult.

You: The Cult? Like Satanist cults?

Chief: Worse, the Cult of Bezos.

You: And why does Amazon need nuclear physicist?

Chief: I've said too much. Anyway, we need to make a trip to the biggest startup dream killer in existence - Silicon Valley
